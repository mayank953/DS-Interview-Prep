# Question: Implementing the Snake and Ladder Game

class Board:
    """
    Design a Python class named `Board` to represent the game board with snakes and ladders.

    Theory:
    The game board consists of a grid of squares, each represented by a number.
    Snakes and ladders are special squares on the board that connect two squares and can either help or hinder a player's progress.

    Operations:
    1. Add Snake: Add a snake to the board.
    2. Add Ladder: Add a ladder to the board.
    3. Check Square: Check if a square contains a snake or ladder and return the destination square if found.

    Test Cases:
    Test Case 1:
    board = Board()
    board.add_snake(14, 7)  # Snake from square 14 to square 7
    assert board.check_square(14) == 7

    Test Case 2:
    board.add_ladder(5, 19)  # Ladder from square 5 to square 19
    assert board.check_square(5) == 19

    Test Case 3:
    # Additional test cases can be added here
    pass

class SnakeAndLadderGame:
    """
    Design a Python class named `SnakeAndLadderGame` to represent the Snake and Ladder game.

    Theory:
    The Snake and Ladder game is a classic board game played between two or more players on a game board
    with numbered, gridded squares. The objective of the game is to reach the final square (usually labeled 100)
    first, starting from square 1.

    Rules:
    - Players take turns to roll a six-sided dice and move their token forward by the number of squares indicated by the dice roll.
    - If a player lands at the base of a ladder, they must climb the ladder to the square at the top.
    - If a player lands on the head of a snake, they must slide down to the square at the tail.
    - The first player to reach or exceed the final square wins the game.

    Operations:
    1. Roll Dice: Simulate rolling a six-sided dice and return the number rolled.
    2. Move Player: Move the current player's token forward by the number of squares indicated by the dice roll.
    3. Check for Win: Check if the current player has won the game.
    4. Display Board: Display the current position of all players on the game board.

    Test Cases:
    Test Case 1:
    game = SnakeAndLadderGame(["Player 1", "Player 2"])
    game.start_game()
    game.roll_dice()
    assert game.current_player == "Player 1"
    assert game.move_player(5) == "Player 1 moved to square 5"
    assert game.check_for_win() is False

    Test Case 2:
    game.roll_dice()
    assert game.current_player == "Player 2"
    assert game.move_player(3) == "Player 2 moved to square 3"
    assert game.check_for_win() is False

    Test Case 3:
    # Additional test cases can be added here
    pass
