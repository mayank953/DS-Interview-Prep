Hi Mayank, Thanks for your support. I cleared all rounds for a company. Need some tips to negotiate. - **Abhishek** 


later pls share some tips on negotiations. Calls I get they bluntly say 30% increment policy.


how does negotiation work?If I negotiate too high, will recruiter reject me completely and I lose the opportunity or they will simply tell me what they can offer?

In my case my HR was fine with 30% hike before interview but after clearing rounds he is saying 20%. He said that by the time you will join you will have more offer and we will revise.
