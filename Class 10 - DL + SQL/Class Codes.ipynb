    "2\\. **Can you explain the evolution of neural networks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Neural networks evolved from simple perceptrons in the 1950s to multi-layer perceptrons, and eventually to deep neural networks. Key milestones include the backpropagation algorithm in the 1980s, the rise of CNNs in the 1990s, and the resurgence of deep learning in the 2010s with advances in computational power and data availability.\n",

    "\n",
    "12\\. **Explain L1 and L2 regularization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - L1 regularization adds the absolute value of the weights to the loss function, promoting sparsity. L2 regularization adds the squared value of the weights, preventing large weights and promoting generalization.\n",

    "\n",
    "17\\. **Explain grid search and random search for hyperparameter tuning.**\n",
